<!--Lesson 2: Getting to Know HTML-->

<!-- Semantics within HTML
    - The practice of giving content on the page MEANING and STRUCTURE by using the proper element.
    - Describes the VALUE of the content on a page; regardless of style/appearance
    - Using SEMANTICS makes it easier for computers, search engines and other devices (screens) to read and understand the content on the web page

Divisions and Spans
<div> and <span> are elements that act as CONTAINERS used for STYLING ONLY (not semantics).
PARAGRAPHS on the other hand are SEMANTIC as they make the content wrapped within a <p> known and understood as a paragraph.
<div>s and <span>s do not hold any meaning and are simply generic containers.

<div>s and <span>s allow targeted styles onto contained sets of content.
A <div> is a BLOCK-level element (identifies LARGE GROUPINGS of content)
    - helps build the webpage layout/design

A <span> is an INLINE-level element (for SMALL GROUPINGS of text)
    - within a block level element

<div>s and <span>s are commonly paired with CLASS or ID attributes for STYLING purposes.

Block vs. Inline Elements
1. BLOCK
    - elements begin on a new line
    - occupy any available width
    - may be nested inside one another
    - may wrap inline elements
    - used usually for LARGER pieces of content; paragraphs

2. INLINE
    - same line
    - fall in normal flow of document; line up one after the other
    - may nest in-line elements
    - cannot wrap block-level elements
    - usually for SMALLER pieces; few words

Using Text Based Elements
1. Headings
    - block-level elements
    - SIX different rankings
        * <h1> to <h6>
    - help break up content and establish hierarchy
    - also help SEARCH ENGINES index and determine content on a page
    - typically used in order

    EXAMPLE: -->
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading Level 1</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 1</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 1</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 1</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 1</h6>

<!--
2. Paragraphs
    - come after Headings (support)
    - defined using <p> block-level element

    EXAMPLE: -->
<p>Steve Jobs was a co-founder and longtime chief executive officer at Apple. On June 12, 2005, Steve gave the commencement address at Stanford University.</p>

<p>In his address Steve urged graduates to follow their dreams and, despite any setbacks, to never give up&ndash;advice which he sincerely took to heart</p>

<!--
3. Bold Text with Strong
    - to make text BOLD and place a STRONG importance on it
    - use <strong> inline-level element

* <strong> is to SEMANTICALLY give STRONG IMPORTANCE
* <b> is solely used to stylistically offset text (reserve), adding no extra significance

    EXAMPLE: -->
<!-->Strong importance-->
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Falling rocks!</p>

<!-- Stylistically offset-->
<p>This recipe calls for <b>bacon</b> and <b>baconnaise</b>.</p>

<!--
4. Italicise Text with Emphasis


Building Structure

Hyperlinks -->

<!-- Division: labelled class SOCIAL for social media content -->
<div class="social">
    <p>You can find me on...</p>
    <p>Additionally, I have a profile on...</p>
</div>

<!-- Span -->
<p>Soon we'll be <span class="tooltip">writing HTML</span> with the best of them.</p>
