/* Specificity Weight */
/*
In order from HIGHEST to LOWEST weight (1 - 3)
1. ID Selector (id="")
    Point value: 1 0 0

2. Class Selector
    Point value: 0 1 0

3. Type Selector
    Point value: 0 0 1

The higher the weight, the higher priority is given to the selector. Therefore, an ID selector would override a class and type selector's values.

Below, you can see the pargraph now has a background of ORANGE, as the id selector #test takes priority.
